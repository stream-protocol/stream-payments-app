## Transact on Shopify with Stream**Pay**™

-   **Easy set-up:** Start accepting USDC payments right away.
-   **Stable payments:** Transactions occur in USDC, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin.
-   **Minimal fees:** A cost-effective alternative to traditional payment rails.
-   **Fast processing:** Take advantage of Solana's near-instant settlement time.
-   **Web3 Loyalty:** Enable web3-native interactions like loyalty programs and more.

## About

Stream**Pay** is currently setup with Shopify and allows integration with your Shopify store. It allows merchants to accept crypto (USDC for now), and offer loyalty programs to their customers.

For the customer, the process is straightforward. At checkout, they would select StreamPay, connect their StreamPay or Solana wallet, and approve the transaction. This process is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly.

Security is a top priority for Stream**Pay**. We do not store personal data about customers beyond their on-chain activity (wallet addresses and USDC or EUROC spent).

If you need assistance or have any questions, please reach out to us at commerce@streampayents.org. You can also visit our [support page](https://merchant.streampayments.app/support) for more information.
