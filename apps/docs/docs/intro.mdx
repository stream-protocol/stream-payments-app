## About

StreamPay is currently setup with Shopify, and allows integration with your Shopify store. It allows merchants to accept crypto (USDC for now), and offer loyalty programs to their customers.

For the customer, the process is straightforward. At checkout, they would select StreamPay, connect their StreamPay or Solana wallet, and approve the transaction. This process is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly.

Security is a top priority for StreamPay. We do not store personal data about customers beyond their onchain activity (wallet addresses and USDC or EUROC spent).

If you need assistance or have any questions, please reach out to us at commerce@solana.com. You can also visit our [support page](https://merchant.streampayments.app/support) for more information.
