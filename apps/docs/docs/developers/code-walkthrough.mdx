# Code Walkthrough

Lets dive into the code and see how it works.

The codebase is a [Turbo monorepo](https://turbo.build/repo). The most important section is the `apps` folder, of which we will cover here

## Backends

We decided to use a serverless architecture of all of our backends, so they are easy to maintain and scale. The servers' handlers are all defined in the apps' `serverless.yml` file.

The backends all use either query strings or bodies, we parse and validate them using `yup`, the schemas of which are in the `models` folders

We use prisma for our database schema, follow the appropriate [prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io) to setup with your database of choice.

### backend-serverless

This is our serverless implementation of all of the logic needed to receive payments/refunds/onboards from Shopify, and serve our frontend with the data they need. This is deployed in 2 parts

#### purple

The purple deployment is the server that our frontend immediately communicate with. Purple talks to the transaction-request-serverless to fetch the payment transaction, displays merchant and customer data. It tells shopify when certain actions are completed, and gets initial starting instructions from green.

#### green

The green deployment is how shopify talks to our app. This deployment handles the [mandatory GDPR webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/webhooks/configuration/mandatory-webhooks), receives instructions directly from shopify to onboard a merchant, and start a transaction. It also watches customer checkouts to see what products the customer is buying. For payments, shopify tells Green how much a payment is for, and Green makes a pending PaymentRecord for that amount.

### transaction-request-serverless

This server constructs the actual transaction customers need to sign. There is a single exposed handler `pay`, which our backend-serverless calls to construct the transaction. The

A transaction request server is an idea coined by [StreamPay](https://docs.solanapayments.app/core/transaction-request/merchant-integration). It is used as a component in the StreamPayments™ Protocol to deliver arbitrary transactions through the scanning of QR codes instead of simple token transfers

We decided to build a transaction request server for a few reasons:

1. Future proof
2. Separation of logic
3. Reusability, for example this transaction request server could also be used for something like dialect smart messages.

### mock-shopify-serverless

This server mimics Shopify's behavior through similarly formatted responses and redirects. It also simulates transactions in its `/payment` handler, either as a test or actual transactions, depending on the boolean test parameter.

## frontends

The frontend´s are both built using Next/tailwind/typescript/radix-ui.

### merchant-ui

This manages all of a merchant's configuration, including onboarding the merchant when they first start, allowing merchants to process refunds (with crypto), view existing crypto payment history, update their settings, and setup their loyalty programs.

M-ui uses zustand for global state management, and the store files all have the various calls made to the backend

### payment-ui

This is the Customer's checkout screen, where they can complete their Shopify purchase with StreamPay.

this ui uses redux, and all the backend calls are located in the slice files.
